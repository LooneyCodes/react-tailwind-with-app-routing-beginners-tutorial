The code files for the 'React Tailwind With App Routing Beginners Tutorial' YouTube playlist series

## Repo Guide
For each video in the playlist series, there will be a specific branch for each one which will contain all the code for that video, where they all can be found in this repo.

In order to find the code related for a specific video, select/checkout into the appropriate branch which matches that video's tag; for instance, each video title has a tag after the pipe symbol ('|'), so a title ending with '| Introduction' will have a corresponding branch in this repo called 'introduction-1'.
